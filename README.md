# SARfish
Ship detection in Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery

**Note: This program is very much a work in progress, and its outputs should not be relied upon for important tasks.**

SARfish is a program designed to help Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) researchers investigate maritime traffic. While the automatic identification system (AIS) tracks most commercial vessels, a small percentage of vessels sail with their AIS transponders off. These vessels are often military vessels, or shipments of illicit/clandestine cargoes, making them of particular interest to researchers. 

The program runs on a Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone retrained on the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0). It takes Sentinel-1 VH polarisation images as an input and outputs a geojson file with points where a ship has possibly been detected.
